# Reoz App - Frontend

 This is the view for the Reoz Game app. 
 
 ##Â Ho to use it
 This is a React application that is still in a development phase. You can run it with `npm start`.
 
 ## What it does
It shows the list of the players' creatures as well as the real-time stock of the game shop.

## What it can't do
It is not yet possible to buy anything nor interact with items / creatures. The application is a simple view at the moment.

The main goal was to learn how to use websocket to allow a server to send events to clients for real-time changes.
